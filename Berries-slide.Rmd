## Summary

In this assignment, we do EAD for data set berries from USDA. After data cleaning and according to data set attributions, we divided the whole berries date set into two parts:

* Bearing: contains information about farm chemical usage.
* Market: with price, yield, area related information.

Besides, we deploy a shiny app [Berries-shiny](https://haoshen.shinyapps.io/Berries-shiny/) for data display and the document recorded the whole processes is in [Berries-rmd](Berries-rmd.pdf).
